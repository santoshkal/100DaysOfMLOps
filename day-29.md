# Task: Configure MLflow with Remote Tracking Server and Artifact Store

The xFusionCorp Industries ML platform team rolled out a shared MLflow deployment backed by a production-style tracking store (PostgreSQL) and a production-style artefact store (SeaweedFS, S3-compatible). The MLflow server is running and metadata writes to PostgreSQL succeed, but a teammate noticed that no artefact ever lands in the mlflow-artifacts SeaweedFS bucket — the connection from MLflow to SeaweedFS is not wired correctly. Diagnose what is broken in the MLflow server's startup configuration, fix it, and re-run the pre-staged smoke-test so one round trip lands metadata in PostgreSQL and the model artefact in SeaweedFS.


1. The pre-staged state:

  - **PostgreSQL** container `mlflow-db` is running on port `5432` (database `mlflow`, credentials `mlflow` / `mlflow123`).
  - **SeaweedFS** is running on port `8333`` (S3 API) / `8888` (Filer UI), credentials `weedadmin` / `weedadmin123`, with a pre-created bucket `mlflow-artifacts`.
  - **MLflow** tracking server is running on port `5000` and was launched by `/root/code/start-mlflow.sh`. Its log is at `/tmp/mlflow.log`.
  - Reference scripts: `/root/code/start-mlflow.sh` (the MLflow startup command), `/root/code/restart-mlflow.sh` (kills the running server and re-launches via `start-mlflow.sh`), and ``/root/code/log_test_run.py` (the smoke-test that exercises one full round trip).


2. Run the smoke-test once to observe the failure:

```
python3 /root/code/log_test_run.py
```


The MLflow run appears in the *MLflow UI* (the metadata write to PostgreSQL succeeds), but the model artefact upload step raises an error because the MLflow server cannot reach the SeaweedFS bucket. The SeaweedFS Filer confirms `/buckets/mlflow-artifacts/` is still empty.

3. Inspect `/root/code/start-mlflow.sh` and reconcile its environment with the SeaweedFS endpoint. Save the file, then restart the MLflow server:

```
   bash /root/code/restart-mlflow.sh
```


4. Re-run the smoke-test:

```
   python3 /root/code/log_test_run.py
```


5. The end state must include:
  - The `test-remote` experiment exists on the MLflow server with at least **one successful** run, visible in the MLflow UI.
  - The `mlflow-artifacts` bucket on SeaweedFS holds the run's model artefact (`MLmodel` + `model.pkl`), visible in the SeaweedFS Filer under `/buckets/mlflow-artifacts/`.
  - The PostgreSQL `mlflow` database holds the MLflow schema (the run's metadata).


> PostgreSQL listens on port 5432 with a binary protocol — it is not reachable from a web browser. Use docker exec mlflow-db psql -U mlflow -d mlflow for manual inspection if needed.

# Solution:


- This task deals with diagnosing and fixing a misconfigured pipeline. Inspect the files `./log_test_run.py`, `start-mlflow.sh`, and `restart-mlflow.sh`.

- Looking at `./log_test_run.py`, it states that:

```
The three env vars MLFLOW_S3_ENDPOINT_URL, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, and
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY are set in the current shell
```

However, when we inspect `./start-mlflow.sh`, we see only `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` are defined, and there is no environment variable set for the SeaweedFS S3 endpoint.

- Update the `./start-mlflow.sh`:

```
#!/bin/bash
# Start the MLflow tracking server with the production-style wiring:
# - PostgreSQL backend for run metadata
# - SeaweedFS (S3-compatible) for artefact storage
# - host/CORS flags so the MLflow UI button works through the lab proxy
set -e

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=weedadmin
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=weedadmin123

# Set the SeaweedFS Endpoint
export MLFLOW_S3_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:8333

exec mlflow server \
  --backend-store-uri postgresql://mlflow:mlflow123@localhost:5432/mlflow \
  --artifacts-destination s3://mlflow-artifacts \
  --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000 \
  --allowed-hosts '*' --cors-allowed-origins '*'
```

- Now run `./restart-mlflow.sh`. This script kills any existing MLflow server process and restarts it. After running this, open a new terminal to tail the logs.

- Next, run `./log_test_run.py` from the terminal where you ran the restart script. You should see success logs printed.


- Verify that the `test-remote` experiment has run and contains a successful run.
